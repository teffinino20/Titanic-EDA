# Titanic Dataset EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
## Introduction

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Titanic dataset. The main goal of this project is to explore and analyze the data to determine the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic.

## Project Overview

The project comprises three main analyses:
1. **Gender and Survival Rate Analysis:** Investigating the association between gender and survival rates using countplots and chi-squared tests.

2. **Passenger Class and Survival Rate Analysis:** Exploring the relationship between passenger class and survival rates with countplots and chi-squared tests.

3. **Age and Survival Rate Analysis:** Analyzing how age is related to survival rates through histograms and box plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the  Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic.
